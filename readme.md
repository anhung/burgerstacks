Burger Stacks  
  
A simple, burger-themed puzzle game playable right from your browser. Check it out at: http://anhung.github.com/burgerstacks  

Instructions  
The goal is to keep the burger stacks from overwhelming you. Move the columns around to match the ingredients on top of the stacks with the ingredients in the spawn row (top row). Matching ingredients will make them disappear and score you points!  
  
You can also create burgers to eliminate multiple ingredients at once! Start building a burger by stacking ingredients on top of a bottom bun. Drop a top bun on top of the stack and watch the whole burger disappear for bonus points! Be careful, though; stack the burger too high and you might not be able to complete it..
